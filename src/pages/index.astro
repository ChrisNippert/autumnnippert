            I'm a Graduate student at UNH studying Computer Science with interests in AI, ML, and NLP, with programming skills in many
            languages including Python, C, Java, and Kotlin. I've made plenty
            of fun side projects in my free time.<br />
            <br />
            I also write and produce music. I've been drumming since elementary
            school, and guitar since high school. I challenged myself to make a
            song every day for the month of December, and continued the
            tradition for a couple of years. This was enough to get me over my
            unreasonable goal of a perfect song that would prevent me from
            releasing music for an indefinite amount of time. I am now focusing
            on more quality than quantity, getting better at
            singing and writing interesting and cohesive stories.<br />
            <br />
            I have a blog with some thoughts and ideas regarding computer science.
