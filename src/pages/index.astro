            I'm a Graduate student at UNH studying Computer Science with interests in AI, ML, and NLP.
            I also have interest in parallel computing with multithreading, distributed systems, and GPU programming.
            I have programming skills in many languages including Julia, Python, Java, and C. I've made a bunch
            of fun side projects in my free time as well.<br />
            <br />
            I also write and produce music. I've been drumming for most of my life,
            and been playing guitar since high school. I challenged myself to make a
            song every day for the month of December, and continued the
            tradition for a couple of years. This was enough to get me over my
            unreasonable goal of a perfect song that was stopping me from
            releasing music. I am now focusing on more quality than quantity, 
            getting better at singing and writing interesting and cohesive stories.<br />
            <br />
            I have a blog with some thoughts and ideas about various topics.
