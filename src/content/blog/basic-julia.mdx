I've been learning Julia recently for a class I'm taking, and I wanted to share some of the things I've learned so far. This also is partially an excuse to test my code and LaTeX rendering.

Before we get started, the syntax is pretty similar to Python but can be strongly typed if you want. It runs using a Just In Time (JIT) compiler, which means that the first time you run a function it will take a bit longer to compile, but subsequent runs will be much faster. When it compiles, some black magic happens and it generates optimized machine code that from my experience can be as fast as C or C++.

# Julia REPL
The way we interact with Julia is through the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). You can start it by running `julia` in your terminal. If you want to stick to more of a script style, you can create a file with a `.jl` extension and run it using `julia filename.jl`.

Anyway when we start Julia, we see something like this:
```

```
Once you're here, you can type Julia code and it will execute it immediately:

```julia
julia> println("Hello World!")
Hello World!
```

# Basic Operations
## Variables and Types
Getting started we will first talk about variables and types. You can declare a variable and assign it a value like so:
```julia
x = 10          # x is an Int
y::Float64 = 3.14        # y is a Float64
name = "Julia"  # name is a String
is_active = true # is_active is a Bool
```

## Arrays and Tuples
Arrays and tuples are just as easy to create:

```julia
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]          # arr is an Array of Ints
tup = (1, 2, 3)                 # tup is a Tuple of Ints
arr_2::Array{Int64} = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Printing to Console
If we want to print out values we can use the `print` or `println` function:

```julia
println("Hello, $name!")  # String interpolation
println("x = $x, y = $y")
println("x + y = ")
print(x + y)  # Note: print does not add a newline
```
This will output:
```
Hello, Julia!
x = 10, y = 3.14
x + y = 13.14
```

## Operations
Some basic arithmetic operations:

```julia
a = 10 + 5      # Addition
b = 10 - 5      # Subtraction
c = 10 * 5      # Multiplication
d = 10 / 5      # Division
e = 10 % 3      # Modulus
f = 10 ^ 2      # Exponentiation
# and if you really want...
d_2 = 5\10 # yes you can do it the other way
@assert d == d_2  # true
```

## Functions
There are three general ways to define functions in Julia. The most common way is using the `function` keyword:
```julia
function greet(name::String)
    println("Hello, $name!")
end

greet("Julia")
```

If your function is simple, you can also use the one-liner syntax to accomplish the same thing:
```julia
greet(name::String) = println("Hello, $name!")
```

You can also create lambda expressions using the `->` syntax:
```julia
greet = name -> println("Hello, $name!")
```

You can use lambdas to do things like map, filter, and reduce on collections:
```julia
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = map(x -> x^2, arr)  # Squares each element in arr
even_numbers = filter(x -> x % 2 == 0, arr)  # Filters even numbers
sum_of_squares = reduce(+, squared)  # Sums all elements in squared
```
This will output:
```
julia> arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

julia> squared = map(x -> x^2, arr)  # Squares each element in arr
5-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  4
  9
 16
 25

julia> even_numbers = filter(x -> x % 2 == 0, arr)  # Filters even numbers
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 4

julia> sum_of_squares = reduce(+, squared)  # Sums all elements in squared
55
```


This is unfinished but good enough for now. I'll update it later
